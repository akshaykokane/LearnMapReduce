# Learning MapReduce in Java

This project is designed to help you learn MapReduce programming in Java by providing example code and exercises. MapReduce is a programming model and processing framework for large-scale data processing in a distributed environment, and it's commonly used in big data applications.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Java and Hadoop installed on your local machine or cluster. You can download Hadoop from the Apache Hadoop website.

Once you have Java and Hadoop installed, you can clone this repository and start working through the exercises. Each exercise is located in a separate folder and contains a README file with instructions on how to complete the exercise.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- src/: Java source code for the MapReduce examples and exercises.
- data/: Sample data files used in the exercises

## Data

1. Input data: Input is the Comma-seprate data, which contains who viewed which user's profile. Example : UserA, UserB, this means User A viewed User B's profile
2. Output data : Count of profile views for each user
